    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. 
        A more efficient algorithm has lower time complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        It is often expressed as O(n), where n is the size of the input.
